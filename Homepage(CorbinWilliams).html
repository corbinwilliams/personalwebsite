     I like to learn about history, whether American, International, or country specific history. Math is one of my least favorite sbjects because I have a hard time grasping knowledge, let alone keeping it inside my mind. English is a bit of a middle ground subject: it's hard to keep up sometimes, but that makes it fun! Other than that, poetry is really nice; more specifcally writing it!

      Personally, I enjoy watching random TV shows and drawing more than I do reading. But I can enjoy a good Junji Ito manga such as Uzumaki, Tomie, Gyo, and No longer Human. But one story that I really enjoyed was Unwind by Neil Shusterman, I really do recoomend it. Currently, I'm reading the Divine Comedy by Dante...with an Italian name.

    <ul class="center">
      <p>Somethings I enjoy:</p>
      <li>Reading fan created works based arond existing properties</li>
      <li>
        Creating heavily storybased, although somewhat boring, pieces of fiction
      </li>
      <li>
        Partaking in the creation of art, albeit isn't on par with DaVinci or
        Picasso. Like seriously anyone who UNIRONICALLY compares themselves is
        narssastic ðŸ’€
      </li>
      <li>
        Watching House M.D, it's a really good medical drama.

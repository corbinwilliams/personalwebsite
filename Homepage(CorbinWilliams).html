      Being stuck in the baseless, monotonus droning on of those around me, I
      have become lost in my own mind; consequently, I haven't been able to
      leave it either. Works of art and literature cloud my train of thoughts,
      cocphanies of noise making it more difficult to grasp what pieces of
      reality I clung onto. Being trapped in a mind of reds, blues, and greens
      may seem terrible, but compared to a world of staring at a screen
      comprised of the same things...well let us say that there is no
      difference. I have free reign over my castle of thought; whereas you have
      no control over the outside world. Isn't that saddening? Besides
      existensalism and denial, I also create storylines of fictional character,
      from my creation or not, just interacting with each other. It's childish,
      but boredom has lead to worse places.

      Whenever I was younger, people told me to follow my dreams; that dreaming
      hard can give us what we want. Trial and error can get us farthr. But in a
      society where perfect is the standard and standards are flawed what's the
      point. Getting past the feelings of despair and lonliness gets me nothing
      more than a slow burn of satisfaction.

        Creating heavily storybased, although somewhat boring, pieces of fiction

      <li>
        Partaking in the creation of art, albeit isn't on par with DaVinci or
        Picasso. Like seriously anyone who UNIRONICALLY compares themselves is
        narssastic ðŸ’€

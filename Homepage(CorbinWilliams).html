      I like to learn about history, whether American, International, or country
      specific history. Math is one of my least favorite subjects because I have
      a hard time grasping knowledge, let alone keeping it inside my mind.
      English is a bit of a middle ground subject: it's hard to keep up
      sometimes, but that makes it fun! Other than that, poetry is really nice;
      more specifcally writing it!

      Personally, I enjoy watching random TV shows and drawing more than I do
      reading. But I can enjoy a good Junji Ito manga such as Uzumaki, Tomie,
      Gyo, and No longer Human. But one story that I really enjoyed was Unwind
      by Neal Shusterman, I really do recoomend it. Currently, I'm reading the
      Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri.

    <ul class="center">
      <p>Somethings I enjoy:</p>
      <li>Reading fan created works based arond existing properties</li>
      <li>
        Creating heavily storybased, although somewhat boring, pieces of fiction
      </li>
      <li>
        Partaking in the creation of art, albeit isn't on par with DaVinci or
        Picasso. Like seriously anyone who UNIRONICALLY compares themselves is
        narssastic ðŸ’€
      </li>
      <li>Watching House M.D, it's a really good medical drama.</li>
      <li>Playing Friday Night Funkin' (Rythme Game released October 2020)</li>
      <li>
        I also really enjoy Heathers (1989) and Heathers the Musical (2014), my
        favorite character is Heather Duke (the green one)
      </li>

      Here are a few things that are't related to media that I enjoy:
    </h2>

    <a href="rat"><img src="images/rat.png" class="rat" /></a>
    <h3>
      Although <span style="color: #abffe0">rats</span> are seen as disgusting creatures, they are among some of the smartest animals. Domesticated rats also are cleaner than dogs or cats; and they are as social if not more so than other pets! Overall, rats are pretty cool!
    </h3>

    <a href="pasta"><img src="images/pasta.png" class="pasta" /></a>
    <h3>
      It's a no-brainer on why <span style="color: #fff0b9">pasta</span> is among some of the greatest forms of food. But beyond the amazing variety of noodles and sauces, pasta itself is just a good food overall. 10/10

    <h3>
      I know I already included art that I made, but I really couldn't help but include this one. It's more messy than the previous but I think it adds character. Speaking of character, this is a piece of  <span style="color: #70ff66">Monika</span> from the game <span style="color:#febdf3">"Doki Doki Literature Club!"</span> (September 2017)

      I like to learn about history, whether American, International, or country
      specific history. Math is one of my least favorite subjects because I have
      a hard time grasping knowledge, let alone keeping it inside my mind.
      English is a bit of a middle ground subject: it's hard to keep up
      sometimes, but that makes it fun! Other than that, poetry is really nice;
      more specifcally writing it!

      Personally, I enjoy watching random TV shows and drawing more than I do
      reading. But I can enjoy a good Junji Ito manga such as Uzumaki, Tomie,
      Gyo, and No longer Human. But one story that I really enjoyed was Unwind
      by Neal Shusterman, I really do recoomend it. Currently, I'm reading the
      Divine Comedy by Dante Alighieri.

    <ul class="center">
      <p>Somethings I enjoy:</p>
      <li>Reading fan created works based arond existing properties</li>
      <li>
        Creating heavily storybased, although somewhat boring, pieces of fiction
      </li>
      <li>
        Partaking in the creation of art, albeit isn't on par with DaVinci or
        Picasso. Like seriously anyone who UNIRONICALLY compares themselves is
        narssastic ðŸ’€
      </li>
      <li>Watching House M.D, it's a really good medical drama.</li>
      <li>Playing Friday Night Funkin' (Rythme Game released October 2020)</li>
      <li>
        I also really enjoy Heathers (1989) and Heathers the Musical (2014), my
        favorite character is Heather Duke (the green one)
      </li>
